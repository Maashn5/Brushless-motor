# Motors
here is the circuts & codes for sevral types of the motors
## Servo Motor
The servo motor rotates in a certain angle between 0 & 180.
The servo motor doesn't need a driver since there is a control board inside the motor, so it directly connect to the arduino
the servo motor has 3 pins:
* 5v pin : connected to the postive pole of the 5v battery or to the 5v pin of the arduino
* Gound pin : connected to negative pole of the battery or to the ground pin of the arduino
* Signal pin : connected to one of the PWM output pins of the arduino
here is the circuit for the servo motor controled by a potentiometer
